\usage{
Learning_fit(output, model, Response_list, Q_list, test_order,
  Test_versions, Q_examinee = NULL, Latency_list = NULL,
  G_version = NA_integer_, R = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{output}{A \code{list} of MCMC outputs, obtained from the MCMC_learning function}

\item{model}{A \code{charactor} of the type of model fitted with the MCMC sampler, possible selections are
"DINA_HO": Higher-Order Hidden Markov Diagnostic Classification Model with DINA responses;
"DINA_HO_RT_joint": Higher-Order Hidden Markov DCM with DINA responses, log-Normal response times, and joint modeling of latent
speed and learning ability;
"DINA_HO_RT_sep": Higher-Order Hidden Markov DCM with DINA responses, log-Normal response times, and separate modeling of latent
speed and learning ability;
"rRUM_indept": Simple independent transition probability model with rRUM responses
"NIDA_indept": Simple independent transition probability model with NIDA responses
"DINA_FOHM": First Order Hidden Markov model with DINA responses}

\item{Response_list}{A \code{list} of dichotomous item responses. t-th element is an N-by-Jt matrix of responses at time t.}

\item{Q_list}{A \code{list} of Q-matrices. b-th element is a Jt-by-K Q-matrix for items in block b.}

\item{test_order}{A \code{matrix} of the order of item blocks for each test version.}

\item{Test_versions}{A \code{vector} of the test version of each learner.}

\item{Q_examinee}{Optional. A \code{list} of the Q matrix for each learner. i-th element is a J-by-K Q-matrix for all items learner i was administered.}

\item{Latency_list}{Optional. A \code{list} of the response times. t-th element is an N-by-Jt matrix of response times at time t.}

\item{G_version}{Optional. An \code{int} of the type of covariate for increased fluency (1: G is dichotomous depending on whether all skills required for
current item are mastered; 2: G cumulates practice effect on previous items using mastered skills; 3: G is a time block effect invariant across
subjects with different attribute trajectories)}

\item{R}{Optional. A reachability \code{matrix} for the hierarchical relationship between attributes.}
}
\value{
A list of DIC matrix, with deviance decomposed to that of the transition model, response model, response time model (if applicable),
and joint model of random parameters, and posterior predictive item means, item odds ratios, item averaged response times, subjects' total
scores at each time point, and subjects' total response times at each time point. Predicted values can be compared to the observed ones from
empirical data.
}
\description{
Obtain joint model's deviance information criteria (DIC) and posterior predictive item means, item response time means,
item odds ratios, subject total scores at each time point, and subject total response times at each time point.
